# Neomorphic Clock

Neomorphic clock that I'm working on. Allows for configuration of timezones. Very experimental style.

You can show the timezone offset by hovering your mouse near the bottom.

You can also change timezone and who it may represent by appending a url hash such as,\
"#-2//Otherworldly Person" changes the offset to GMT-2 and dedicates it to Otherworldly Person.

Todo,
    I'm pretty sure the clock itself doesn't actually work, should it be GMT or UTC?\
    Make a hint that tells you how to change the offset as currently it's pretty hidden.\
    Color changing abilities? Shouldn't be too hard.\
    Light mode!\
